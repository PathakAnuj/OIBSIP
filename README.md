# OIBSIP
This is a repository created for my web development internship at Oasys Infobyte. During the Level 1 tasks, I was assigned to create three websites: a landing website, my portfolio website, and a temperature converter website -
1) Landing website:
   Used simple HTML and CSS to create a webpage.
   Includes a navigation bar, banner section, left and right sections, and a footer.
   
2) Portfolio website:
   Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   
3) Temperature converter website:
   Added an input section that only accepts numerical values in degrees.
   Includes a dropdown list for Fahrenheit and Kelvin format.
   Added a "Convert" button that will convert the input into the chosen parameter.
